This is the repository for the Course Management System our group is designing for CS250

Course Management System:

Our course management system will contain overarching course classes, and will be able to
keep track of instructors, rosters, and students. The student class will be an individual class that
will calculate a student's grade given the data submitted in the assignments and tests classes. 

- Course class: a class that handles description of given course
  - Instructor: class for the instructors
  - Roster: class for tracking roster of students
  - Student: class for the overall object of individual Student
    - Grade: class tracking the grade of the student in given course
    - Assignments: class tracking the completion of all assignments and homework
      - Individual assignment: an object class to track the details of a specific assignment
    - Tests: class tracking the performance of students on exams
